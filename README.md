# libdani

A collection of Python code that is not big to be it's own package.
So like my own stdlib.

## Installation

Can be installed with:

```
pip install libdani
```

But it's mostly designed to copy/paste into your specific project and modify
as needed. Like [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

Each module has a README and some examples.
